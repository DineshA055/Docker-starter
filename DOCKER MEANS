What is Docker ?

 Docker is an open source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update and manage containersâ€”standardized, executable components 
that combine application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

Docker in simple term

Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. 
The isolation and security lets you run many containers simultaneously on a given host.

Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers.

DOCKER ARCHITECTURE :- `

Docker uses a client-server architecture.
The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers. 
The Docker client and daemon can run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon. 
The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface. 
Another Docker client is Docker Compose, that lets you work with applications consisting of a set of containers.
